## Per Diem

Some organizations use **per diem** allowances to simplify reimbursements for meals and lodging. These are fixed daily rates that vary based on location and are either determined by:
- Government regulations (e.g., GSA rates in the US)
- Internal company policies

Employees do not need to submit individual meal receipts when per diem applies, unless otherwise specified.

Expenses generally **not covered** under travel reimbursement include:

- Fines or penalties (e.g., parking tickets)
